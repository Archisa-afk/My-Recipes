To create scruptious pasta, follow the recipe.
Step 1: Boil your pasta (one box) and add a pinch of salt then let it sit. Rinse it in a bit, when it is soft. 
Step 2: Cut up your veggies. Cut the onions into long, thin slices, and cut the olives into circles. Defrost the corn that was in your freezer. Make sure to chop up at least 4 cloves of garlic, finely chopped.
Step 3: After the pasta is boiled and everything is ready, get out a huge pan and pour in about 2-3 table spoons of olive oil.
Step 4: Let the oil get a little hot and then add the garlic. After you saute for a couple of minutes, add the onions and saute them until they are soft and transparent.

Step 7: Drain the Pasta and add it to the mix. Mix it and cover the pan with a lid, letting the pasta sit and cook for 5 minutes.
